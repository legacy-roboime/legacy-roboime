RoboIME SSL Computational Project
=================================

Introduction
------------
This solution aims to provide a set of software to take full control of the
robots on an autonomous match, and to aid its development by providing
facilities such as a Simulation environment.


System Requirements
-------------------
We plan to support compilation on linux/osx on the future. But currently
it only compiles on windows with visual studio compiler.
The following are the requirements to compile and develop on this project:

- Visual Studio 2010 with AnkhSVN plugin
- Qt SDK 4.8.0 (currently on RC)
- Qt VS Add-in for VS 2010
- PhysX SDK 2.8.4 (*)(**)

*PhysX SDK dependencies are included on the _include_ thus it will compile
without PhysX, but it's still needed to run the portions that use Simulation.
**Note also that this version of PhysX does not compile on linux/osx, however
the next version 3.x.x does, it is planned to migrating to 3.x.x.
